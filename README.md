#### <i>Prerequisites</i>

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.js®` and an `npm` package manager.

###### Node.js

[**Angular 17**](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular) requires `Node.js` LTS version `^18.13` or `^20.09`.

- To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

###### Angular CLI

Install the Angular CLI globally using a terminal/console window.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm update
```

### Basic usage

```bash
# dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:4200
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run `build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

```bash
# build for production with minification
$ npm run build
```

## What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```
coreui-free-angular-admin-template
├── src/                         # project root
│   ├── app/                     # main app directory

## Documentation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.0.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, CoreUI Free Admin Template is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/).

See [the Releases section of our project](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-angular-admin-template/releases) for changelogs for each release version.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
